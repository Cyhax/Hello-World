Just another repository

Hi there!  Welcome to my readme.  I suggest reading it with the companionship of a octopus and a rabbit who are both interested in intergalactic space travel and need your assistance as neither are a rocket scientist.  You're not a rocket scientist you say?  I don't believe it, all you need to do is program yourself out of a brown paper bag and they won't know the difference, and you know what?  Neither will I.  

I suggest building it out of carrots, the rabbit will like that.
